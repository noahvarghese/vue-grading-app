# Simple Vue app
===

## Description
This lab is made to be as simple a vue app as possible, no npm packages are necessary. (Except to compile the scss)
The requirements were simplistic vue app, and I wanted to learn scss, so here's the compromise.
This a purely local app, no server calls ecept for page load, all data is stored lcient side.
